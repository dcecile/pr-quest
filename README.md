# [The PR Quest (Canada edition)](https://pr-quest.netlify.com)
_Tracking our progress toward proportional representation in Canada_

PR in Canada is a bit "stalled" right now. The PM has declared PR bad for the country, maybe because the
all-party committee found that AV would undemocratic, and the original promise to replace FPTP has been
abandoned.

One next step is to try to get the House of Commons to vote that the government adopts the recommendation
of the Electoral Reform report. This web app aims to track our progress toward securing that support from
Liberal MPs.
